# network-performance-monitoring
## Objective
Monitor the health of telecommunications infrastructure and customer service metrics to ensure high service quality, minimize downtime, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Data Sources
Integrate relevant data to gain a comprehensive view of network performance:
 - Network Management Systems: Monitor network latency, downtime, and fault detection.
 - Customer Service Logs: Track customer complaints, support tickets, and satisfaction scores.
 - Telecom Billing Systems: Analyze revenue metrics, such as ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
### 2. Metrics
Define critical metrics to evaluate network performance and customer satisfaction:
 - Network Downtime: Measure the total time the network is unavailable.
 - Service Quality: Track network latency, fault occurrences, and packet loss.
 - Customer Satisfaction: Use feedback and satisfaction scores to gauge service performance.
 - Revenue Per User (ARPU): Monitor revenue generated per customer to understand profitability.
### 3. Power BI Features Utilized
Use Power BIâ€™s capabilities to create insightful visualizations and actionable dashboards:
 #### 1. Network Health Dashboards:
  - Bar Charts: Show key performance indicators such as network downtime and latency trends.
  - Heatmaps: Highlight regions or network nodes experiencing frequent faults.
#### 2. Customer Churn Analysis:
 - Scatter Plots: Correlate churn rates with customer satisfaction scores and service issues.
 - Regression Analysis: Identify factors driving customer churn to develop targeted strategies.
#### 3. Real-time Data Monitoring:
 - Streaming Data Integration: Monitor live metrics like network usage and fault detection to enable swift issue resolution.

## Actionable Insights
With Power BI dashboards, telecom companies can:
#### 1. Optimize Network Performance:
 - Pinpoint and resolve issues in high-latency or fault-prone areas.
 - Minimize downtime by analyzing historical fault trends.
#### 2. Enhance Customer Retention:
 - Identify at-risk customers based on churn analysis and satisfaction scores.
 - Develop targeted offers or service improvements to retain high-value customers.
#### 3. Maximize Revenue:
 - Monitor ARPU trends to identify profitable customer segments.
